# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Designed a Driver Drowsiness Detection system employing machine
learning and neural networks. Implemented facial recognition
algorithms for real-time monitoring, issuing alerts, and triggering a
beep sound upon detecting signs of driver drowsiness. The project
aimed to enhance road safety by proactively addressing driver fatigue.
Successfully implemented and validated the solution for robust
performance.
